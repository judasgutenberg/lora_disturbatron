# lora_disturbatron
A Disturbatron operating over LoRa


The idea is to have an app on a computer that communicates via LoRa similar to the web-based Disturbatron.
Wait, has anyone ever actually gotten LoRa to do anything?  Okay, thanks to Andreas Spiess, I did get it working. I will definitely be including all my Hello World sketches in this repo.
